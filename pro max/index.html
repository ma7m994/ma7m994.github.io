        <!-- Tool 1 -->
        <div class="tool">
            <img src="photos/3.jpg" alt="Curved Knife or Hook Tool">
            <h2>Curved Knife or Hook Tool</h2>
            <p>This instrument resembles a hooked blade and was likely used for surgical procedures, particularly in mummification. The curved shape of the blade would have made it effective for making incisions, possibly to remove organs or to perform other delicate procedures within the body.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Tool 2 -->
        <div class="tool">
            <img src="photos/4.jpg" alt="Scalpel or Surgical Knife">
            <h2>Scalpel or Surgical Knife</h2>
            <p>This tool looks like a scalpel and would have been used for making precise cuts. Ancient Egyptian surgeons used similar tools for various surgical procedures, such as excising tumors or opening abscesses. The pointed end and sharp blade suggest it was designed for detailed work.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Tool 3 -->
        <div class="tool">
            <img src="photos/5.jpg" alt="Forceps or Tweezers">
            <h2>Forceps or Tweezers</h2>
            <p>These appear to be ancient forceps or tweezers, which would have been used for grasping or removing small objects, such as foreign bodies from wounds or during other surgical procedures. The simplicity of the design indicates it was a basic but essential tool in the medical kit of an ancient Egyptian physician.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Tool 4 -->
        <div class="tool">
            <img src="photos/2.jpg" alt="Long Hooked Tool">
            <h2>Long Hooked Tool</h2>
            <p>This long, thin hooked instrument could have been used in medical procedures, particularly for accessing deep or narrow parts of the body. It might have been used to extract materials from deep wounds or during mummification to remove organs.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Tool 5 -->
        <div class="tool">
            <img src="photos/1.jpg" alt="Spatula or Broad Surgical Knife">
            <h2>Spatula or Broad Surgical Knife</h2>
            <p>This tool resembles a broad spatula or a flat surgical knife, used for various purposes such as spreading ointments or cutting through larger surfaces. It might have also been used in the separation of tissues or during the mummification process.</p>
